#1. In Pandas, a Series object is capable of holding data of any type (list, tuple, dictionaries, range object, etc.)

import pandas as pd
#2
s = pd.Series(np.arange(1, 13), index = ["January", "February", "March", "April", "May", "June", "July", "August", "September", "October", "November", "December"])
print(s)

#3
students_number = {"MatMIE" : 40, "MatDAIS" : 36, "COMIE" : 45, "COMCE" : 45}
print(pd.Series(students_number))
